<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>
This week we learned to use a couple different power tools (such as a scroll saw), as well as some hands tools and how to solder. I am now certified and trained in the basics to work with machines that cut, drill, or shape metal as well. We also learned about the many different types of motors, how electricity flows in a circuit, and tested some code on a microcontroller.

<h4>What is a kinetic sculpture?</h4>

<br></br>

 A popular definition is "art that depends on motion for it's effect." So here is...<br></br>

  Beyond being a sculpture it can also do a lot of cool things!

(It can travel down a plane that it wouldn't be able to if it wasn't vibrating.)
<br></br>
<h4>But how did I make it?</h4>
<br></br>
I started out with a concept. I really liked the vibratory motor when we went over motors because it's so unique. I wanted to do something with it, and immediately thought of hexbugs:

<br></br>
So, I wanted to make a larger, artistic version.
<br></br>
I started with creating a general concept in fusion with how big I wanted the final product to be. Here is the general sketch I came up with, with and without dimensions for reference:
<br></br>

<br></br>
I was also thinking about how the motor & circuit would function. I knew the switch had to be outside the box, but I wanted a clean look with wires and components on the inside. I also knew that the motor needed to be extremely secure, so that the body itself would vibrate and not just the motor. To ensure this, I accounted for the kerf of the laser cutter in my dimensions.

<br></br>
First, to make sure that the general design had no errors, I created a tiny prototype!

<br></br>
Then I created the circuit that would create the vibrations I needed with a switch to turn them off! In doing this, I recognized that I needed to change my design a little bit and create another two holes to feed wire through in the baseboard. 
<br></br>

<br></br>
I made small changes to my design, and then prepared to lasercut it. This was my first time laser cutting wood!

<br></br>
It came out perfectly, and all the parts fit together flush! The motor sits especially well in it's designated place:

<br></br>
I decided that I would hot glue the parts instead of using wood glue. This is because it creates joints that allow some rubbery vibrational movement, and also protects their longevity. These are weaker connections, so I had the idea to reinforce these joints with fabric that the hot glue would seep into and hook onto more.
<br></br>

<br></br>
I then made the walls, and had to 1/2 them because they were a bit too tall. I made the front and back walls for the motor box out of cardboard so that they would bend! I fastened the wires to the bottom, away from the motor's reach, and worked on the vibrational mechanism. I eventually settled on a wire connected to a bolt, hot glued to the motor, and it works really well!

<br></br>
I then sanded all of the edges and used a dremel to make designs on the  top and bottom layer. This was also to drop some weight!

Fun Fact: If you turn her upside-down like a hexbug and she rests on her antennas she moves quicker and in a straight line.
<br></br>



<h4>Soldering</h4>
<br></br>
In order to practice soldering, I made the little prototype version move. I used a button battery, a circuit board that holds it and has a switch, a small vibratory motor, and soldered connections between the wires.
<br></br>
I also soldered a microcontroller! See below:
