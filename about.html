     I'm from Long Island, New York. My family is Czech, so thats why my name is pronounced "Hana" not Hannah, don't think you're wrong! I hear people hesitate all the time.
     <br></br>
    I'm in Thayer Hall, and planning on concentrating in either mechanical or biomedical engineering with a secondary in central European studies and a citation in Czech.

In engineering and for this class I'm focused on mechanical systems that use the symmetry of the human body to 
<br></br>
-increase quality of life- 
<br></br>
at a 
<br></br>
-low cost-
<br></br>
 for conditons that impair bilateral movement, such as stroke, cogenital paralysis and paresis, amputation, or Bell's Palsy. 
<br></br>
I'm super excited that this lab is so advanced and stocked, as I'm already thinking of what I can do with the machines and hardware!
<br></br>
In my free time I like to read classics, work on my music (spotify in 2026?) go to the gym, and run two social media accounts! @itshannahbrave and @bumbaleen, one where I teach Czech and one where I draw cartoon bunnies. 
<br></br>
vvv Here's a bunny I drew the other day!
