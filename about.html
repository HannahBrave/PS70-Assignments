    Hey! I'm Hannah, from Long Island, New York. My family is Czech, so thats why my name is pronounced Hana not Hannah, don't think you're wrong! I hear people hesitate all the time. I grew up split between Czechia and LI so I have a lot of both in me. I'm in Thayer Hall, and plannning on concentrating in either mechanical or biomedical engineering with a secondary in Central European Studies and a citation in Czech.

In engineering, and for this class, I'm focused on mechanical systems that use the symmetry of the human body to increase quality of life at a low cost for conditons that impair bilateral movement, such as stroke, cogenital paralysis and paresis, amputation, or Bell's Palsy. Super excited that this lab is so advanced and stocked as I'm already thinking of so many things I can do with the machines and hardware!  As well as place more
images if you are interested in those things
