<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

Drumroll please...

<h4>Idea 1 : New type of limb prosthetic (starting with just the thumb) </h4>
<img src="./IMG_6108.jpeg" width = "300">
<p class = "margin"></p>

Mechanically functions using the symmetry of the human body. Would work well for 
<br></br>
-amputees
<br></br>
-stroke patients
<br></br>
-people born with paresis or partial paralysis
<br></br>
 to gain back a certain level of independence/quality of life. Needs to be easy to produce and low in cost/electronics. There is a high demand for this right now in certain parts of the world.

<h4>Idea 2: Body Charger</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

For ultrarunners: when running long distances you're far away from all sources to charge your electronics. This would use the biolological energy of the human body, converting kinetic movement into potential energy which can charge your phone or smartwatch.

<h4>Idea 3: New kind of facial prosthetic</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

For people born with partial paralysis of the face, stroke patients, or patients with Bell's Palsy, the muscles in the face become weaker, are weaker, or are at risk of degererating over time. A lot of facial expressions that cannot be made when a patient has partial paralysis rely on the symmetry of the human body: ex. smiling. 
<br></br>
The muscles on one side of the face rely on electrical pulses that cause them to move. If those electrical pulses can be mimicked in real time, and mirrored to the other side of the face, muscles that may not have nerve connection may be able to function. Technology needs to eventually be small enough to deliver those pulses through a sticker that can be applied to the face that is fully non-invasive w/ no implants. For now, the technology can be larger and directed toward exercising those muscles with e-stim in order to prevent muscular degeneration.
