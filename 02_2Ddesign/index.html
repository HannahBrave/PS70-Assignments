<h4>Making a Box...</h4>
Theme: Alice in Wonderland
<img src="./IMG_6339.jpg" width = "200">
<br></br>
Here was my earliest succesful box prototype!
<br></br>
<img src="./beep.jpg" width = "400">

(In fusion) It includes...
<br></br>
1. Funky asymmetrical windows
<br></br>
2. A quote on the bottom that I hand drew in fusion (both because I couldn't get text to transfer to the Rhino software [Bobby fixed it]
<br></br>
{Bless you Bobby}
<br></br>
 and because I DID want it to be a bit esoteric)
<br></br>
3. The word "Wonderland" carved in the lid.
<br></br>
 (This earlier prototype didn't have a closeable lid, rather one that just sits on top)
<br></br>

<img src="./helll.jpeg" width = "200">

<br></br>This was a bit too small, but I liked the idea and wanted to add more details as well. 
<br></br>
BUT...
<br></br>
I was super happy with how clean and even the corners turned out: 
<br></br>
<img src="./right.jpeg" width = "200">
crrispyyy
<br></br>
Next I changed the dimensions a bit! I added details and figured out the measurement that would allow the lid to close by a flap that tucks inside.
<br></br>
<img src="./woo.jpeg" width = "500">
<br></br>
It took me so long to map out what lines had to be cut vs. scored vs. engraved in the laser cutter software. I settled on this:
<br></br>
<img src="./yuppp.jpg" width = "500">
<br></br>
However, I didn't like how the laser cutter engraved my bunny design so I decided to replace it with a card design. I also decided to use my prototype box to make the house two layers, like a cake!
<br></br>
Here is my completed box design! I'm very happy with her!
<br></br>
<img src="./IMG_6355.jpeg" width = "300">
<img src="./IMG_6354.jpeg" width = "500">
<img src="./IMG_6353.jpeg" width = "300">
<img src="./IMG_6356.jpeg" width = "300">
<img src="./IMG_6359.jpeg" width = "300">
<img src="./IMG_6360.jpeg" width = "300">
<br></br>

<br></br>
Here is the lid closing mechanism:

<h4>Assignment 2: Fusion 360 Tutorial</h4>
<br></br>

<br></br>
Here is a tutorial I did on making a lego brick and then one making a glass bottle! It helped me understand the dynamics of fusion SO much better, I was so pleased. Now I also understand why a caliper is so valuable for modeling things in their real size. I'm also thinking/hoping that this software will be what we use for 3D printing and I'm very excited!

<br></br>
I think in the near future I will continue to complete this series of videos to get more comfortable with the software, and for fun!

This is the beginning of the series above!
<br></br>
<h4>Assignment 3: Fusion Modeling</h4>
<br></br>
I worked in fusion to model two items in the lab, making sure they're the same size in real life by measuring them with calipers!
<br></br>
Here are my airpods:

And here is my thumb! I thought it may come in handy to have it for future prosthetics.
